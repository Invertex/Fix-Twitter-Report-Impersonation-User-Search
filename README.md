# Fix-Twitter-Report-Impersonation-User-Search
Fixes the user list searching when reporting a user for "Impersonation", so it will always show the user you're searching.

# Installation
To install this User Script, you need a User Script manager installed in your browser. There are plenty of options such as:<br/>
[Tamper Monkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (PREFERRED) or [Violent Monkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey).<br/>
Install one to the browser of your choice.

Then click [this link](https://github.com/Invertex/Fix-Twitter-Report-Impersonation-User-Search/raw/refs/heads/main/fix_twitter_impersonation_search.user.js), and your User Script manager should take you to an install page. (Otherwise, visit the RAW of `fix_twitter_impersonation_search.user.js`)
